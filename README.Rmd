**svcmr** is intended for specifying models combining structural equation models with sparse relationship matrices. A relationship matrix may for example encode the genetic relatedness among individuals or different forms of shared environments. The interface is is inspired by **OpenMx**, but uses the **Matrix** and **sparseMVN** R-packages for computation. 

### Example code
