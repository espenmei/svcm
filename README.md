**svcmr** is intended for easy specification of models combining
structural equation models with sparse relationship matrices. A
relationship matrix may for example encode the genetic relatedness among
individuals or different forms of shared environments. The interface is
inspired by **OpenMx**, but uses the **Matrix** and **sparseMVN**
R-packages for computation.
